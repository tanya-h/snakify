# Snake #
This is the next step of implementing the Snake. Now it can eat different foods. Eat a pink cupcake to grow, or a green one to get one more life. Eating a bug will shrink the Snake, and a dynamite will make it explode.
TODO list: 
	- fix the exploion animation
	- add advanced tweaks.
Still open to your suggestions.
