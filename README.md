# Snake #
This is the very first simplistic impl of the Snake game.
TODO list: 
	- decrease delay as more points are gained
	- enable field resize  => refactor the code 
	- enable field size choice (3 sizes)
	- enable level choice (initial speed) 
	- add poisoned food
	- add skin patters
	- add screan rotation? split the snake? let it explode?
Open to your suggestions.
